## Overview

I might touch this up and add payments to turn it into a sort of betting game.

## Rules

Both players are represented by circles. They're dropped at random points into
a 400x400 pixel playing field. Each player can 'attack' by clicking on the
board. This transports their circle to the point they clicked. If there is an
opponent there, the opponent is vanquished.

## How to run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sharafian/mouse-joust.git
cd moust-joust
npm install
npm start
open localhost:8080
```
